	* for any semi-public release

		* readme.md for github (linking to manual.md, build_and_review.md)
		* rebase and push to github once code is de-cluttered
		* release (trhough github files?), hashes?
		* LICENSE

	* beta n+1

		* calin on signalling: if you wanted to delete the signal you could call util.do_in_main_thread (util lives in the electroncash module)
		* skip "tip received" messages in reddit.markChaintipMessagesUnread()
		* quick deactivate/activate leads to error
		* when tipping posts, subreddit is not parsed
		* self.tip_or_message_by_message[message.id] = tip <- can be replace by self.wallet_ui.tiplist.tips, because getID() is now message.id
		* mark messages read on digestion
		* can I remove tip.read_status??? should I?
		* can I remove tip.type? (all are "send", I guess)
		* looks like saving sorting prefs on tiplist is broken
		* mark_read doesn't work on stored tips (no chaintip_message)
		* remove "iterators" bundled depependency
		* weird empty frames popping up like with thunderbird
		* chaintipper button: switch to deactivated only after everything is wound down
		* on network trouble, autpay will trigger :-(

	* beta n+2

		* copy recipient (tipee) address
		* set amount...
		* top up, double down
		* move reddit forget button to settings
		* move back to chaintipper tab after "pay..."?

		* about box (see main_window:772)

		* have praw devs considered this issue: https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues/1732 ? if so, update praw and our patch

	* consider it

		* discrepancy between recent rate and historical rate (default amount will look bad)

		* treeview beauty
			* use monospaced font like on history tab
			* align right (or better decimal point) amount columns
			* amount colums: sort by number, not text


		* detect payment status from other wallets (use network, blockchain whatever)

		* history rate available if "show history rate" unchecked?

		* parse chaintip confirmation comment <- no added value?

		* Jon F suggestoin: re-enable "autopay" menu entry for quickly paying tips when autopay is off (currently doesn't work because tips are filtered for autopay-eligible ones only) or "send now" that ignores all autopay constraints

		* Jon F: "double clicking in the Chaintipper tab should open the "pay..."/send window"

		* default tip amount currency: add BCH option

		* headless operation

		* pla-plingggg sound?

		* menu-item "set amount" with a dialog

		* reddit logon: display "waiting for yout to authorize chaintipper to access your reddit account, check your browser"?

		* amount_bch sometimes scientific notation "1.0E-7", format it

		* reddit.py receive loop: reparse amount on Comment change?

		* preferences
			* amount config (tip amount monikers)

		* currently using first exchange found for the given ccy, maybe improve?

		* html preview of tipping message? even parent?

		* auto-edit tipping message ("EDIT: paid with chaintipper EC plugin")

	* 2.0 / ideas

		* re-allow amount_bch editable, (if payment_status!='paid')

		* enable "incoming"/"outgoing" categories
			* category "read" for read items?
			* category collapse icon, subitem indentation
			* BUG: right-click on category -> exception
	
		* twitter
		* persist Tip List
		* utxo selection with fuzzy tip amounts (min_amount, max_amount)
		* tooltips in table?
