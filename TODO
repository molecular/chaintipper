	* for any semi-public release

		* readme.md for github (linking to manual.md, build_and_review.md)
		* rebase and push to github once code is de-cluttered
		* release (trhough github files?), hashes?
		* LICENSE

	* beta n+1

		* possibly reddit isn't shut down on wallet close. (use cosigner plugin to turn on request debug, close chaintipper wallet and observe there are still requests)
		* looks like uppercase U/chaintip doesn't work
		* tip amount text not shown?
		* tip amount text newlines screw up gui (reported by remora around 10.9.2021)
		* "ChainTip" column -> "Stealth" column

	* beta n+2

		* calin on signalling: if you wanted to delete the signal you could call util.do_in_main_thread (util lives in the electroncash module)
		* set amount...
		* top up, double down
		* move reddit forget button to settings
		* move back to chaintipper tab after "pay..."?
		* new column: received USD

		* menu-item "set amount" with a dialog

		* about box (see main_window:772)

		* have praw devs considered this issue: https://github.com/praw-dev/praw/issues/1732 ? if so, update praw and our patch

	* consider it

		* discrepancy between recent rate and historical rate (default amount will look bad)

		* treeview beauty
			* use monospaced font like on history tab
			* align right (or better decimal point) amount columns
			* amount colums: sort by number, not text

		* history rate available if "show history rate" unchecked?

		* parse chaintip confirmation comment <- no added value?

		* Jon F suggestoin: re-enable "autopay" menu entry for quickly paying tips when autopay is off (currently doesn't work because tips are filtered for autopay-eligible ones only) or "send now" that ignores all autopay constraints

		* Jon F: "double clicking in the Chaintipper tab should open the "pay..."/send window"

		* default tip amount currency: add BCH option

		* headless operation

		* pla-plingggg sound?

		* reddit logon: display "waiting for yout to authorize chaintipper to access your reddit account, check your browser"?

		* amount_bch sometimes scientific notation "1.0E-7", format it

		* reddit.py receive loop: reparse amount on Comment change?

		* preferences
			* amount config (tip amount monikers)

		* currently using first exchange found for the given ccy, maybe improve?

		* html preview of tipping message? even parent?

		* auto-edit tipping message ("EDIT: paid with chaintipper EC plugin")

	* 2.0 / ideas

		* re-allow amount_bch editable, (if payment_status!='paid')

		* enable "incoming"/"outgoing" categories
			* category "read" for read items?
			* category collapse icon, subitem indentation
			* BUG: right-click on category -> exception
	
		* twitter
		* persist Tip List
		* utxo selection with fuzzy tip amounts (min_amount, max_amount)
		* tooltips in table?
