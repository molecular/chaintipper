	* 1.0

		* for any semi-public release

			* make tg group for beta testers (don't call it beta, just "chaintipper")

			* divert error reports to my github
			* clean up the code
			* readme.md for github
			* rebase and push to github once code is de-cluttered
			* release (trhough github files?), hashes?

	* beta4

		* do it

			* don't use send to many if only 1 tip
			* reparse tips on relevant config change?
			* autopay disallow default amount is broken
			* autopay on 3rd tx in a row doublespends
			* settings: only refresh on relevant changes


			* better tipUpdated implementation (the flickering und sort-screwing sucks)
			* column with <subreddit> of tip
			* save settings only at dialog close? what other places write config, though?
			* reparse tips after relevant settings edited

		* consider it

			* segfault on close (at least on blackbox)
			* maybe related: Plugin.close_wallet does nothing

			* re-enable "autopay" menu entry for quickly paying tips when autopay is off (currently doesn't work because tips are filtered for autopay-eligible ones only) or "send now" that ignores all autopay constraints
			* double clicking in the Chaintipper tab should open the "pay..."/send window
			* parse "u/chaintip $1.50"?
			* another column in Chaintipper could be 'subreddit'.
			* checkmark if user has already linked an address, or empty if they havent.

	* later

	* 2.0 / ideas

		* new column: amount_fiat (using historical rate), but maybe only if "fiat" user prefs say so

		* re-allow amount_bch editable, (if payment_status!='paid')
