		* do it

			* segfault on close (at least on blackbox)

			* parse "u/chaintip $1.50"?

			* mark_read (including claim/return messages)

			* setting to "Stop autotip if the user has already linked a wallet. "

		* consider it

			* save settings only at dialog close? what other places write config, though?

			* detect payment status from other wallets (use network, blockchain whatever)
			* history rate available if "show history rate" unchecked?

			* parse chaintip confirmation comment

			* re-enable "autopay" menu entry for quickly paying tips when autopay is off (currently doesn't work because tips are filtered for autopay-eligible ones only) or "send now" that ignores all autopay constraints
			* double clicking in the Chaintipper tab should open the "pay..."/send window


	* later

		* pla-plingggg sound?

		* autopay_amount_currency: add BCH option

		* menu-item "set amount" with a dialog

		* reddit logon: display "waiting for yout to authorize chaintipper to access your reddit account, check your browser"?

		* amount_bch sometimes scientific notation "1.0E-7", format it

		* reddit.py receive loop: reparse amount on Comment change?

		* preferences
			* tip amounts

		* currently using first exchange found for the given ccy, maybe improve?
		* html preview of tipping message? even parent?
		* auto-edit tipping message ("EDIT: paid with chaintipper EC plugin")

	* 2.0 / ideas

		* new column: amount_fiat (using historical rate), but maybe only if "fiat" user prefs say so

		* re-allow amount_bch editable, (if payment_status!='paid')

		* avoid having to ask credentials by using "reddit app" (api-key)?
			(see https://asyncpraw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html under "Client ID & Client Secret" for pointers)

		* enable "incoming"/"outgoing" categories
			* category "read" for read items?
			* category collapse icon, subitem indentation
			* BUG: right-click on category -> exception
	
		* context menu:
			* go to tipping comment (open browser)
			* "view payment tx"?

		* twitter
		* persist Tip List
		* utxo selection with fuzzy tip amounts (min_amount, max_amount)
		* tooltips in table?
