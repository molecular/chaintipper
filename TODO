	* raintipper

		* only add "instantiate raintipper" entry to chaintipper menu on reddit connect, remove entry on reddit disconnect
		* locate_root_object: currently looking only for Submission and only by url. Also look for Comment and also by name/id

		* changes to chaintipper that make sense for raintipper
			* option (in default for unlinked users): [ ] do not tip unlinked users at all if tip was done in stealth-mode (by PM to chaintip)
			* mark tips with amount "0" as finished somehow? 

		* [Raintipper] can't recurse, type of o: <class 'electroncash_plugins.chaintipper.praw.models.reddit.more.MoreComments'>
		* check if user has been tipped at all => "ineligible, tipped before"

	* bugs

		* tip amount text = "1" when using default ("/u/chaintip" only)
		* if tip is not paid with payment="won't pay 0", one cannot manually pay and the tip is grayed out
		* set "set amount to 0 for stealth", make stealth tip (wont be paid), unset "set amount to 0 for stealth" => doesn't reconsider and pay
		* I think "_" in username (and probably other special chars) screw the parser. Example are some stealth tips falsely categorized as "linked"
			example: "u/franane__ has not yet linked their wallet with chaintip to receive tips.", but tip is shown as "linked"

	* beta n

		* maybe update readme.md
		* write build_and_review.md
		* LICENSE
		* include manual in release assets?
		
	* beta n+1

		* document export feature

		* implement WalletUI.show_settings_dialog

	* beta n+2

		* calin on signalling: if you wanted to delete the signal you could call util.do_in_main_thread (util lives in the electroncash module)
		* set amount...
		* top up, double down
		* move reddit forget button to settings
		* move back to chaintipper tab after "pay..."?
		* new column: received USD

		* menu-item "set amount" with a dialog

		* about box (see main_window:772)
		* possibly reddit isn't shut down on wallet close. (use cosigner plugin to turn on request debug, close chaintipper wallet and observe there are still requests)

	* consider it

		* discrepancy between recent rate and historical rate (default amount will look bad)

		* treeview beauty
			* use monospaced font like on history tab
			* align right (or better decimal point) amount columns
			* amount colums: sort by number, not text

		* history rate available if "show history rate" unchecked?

		* parse chaintip confirmation comment <- no added value?

		* Jon F suggestoin: re-enable "autopay" menu entry for quickly paying tips when autopay is off (currently doesn't work because tips are filtered for autopay-eligible ones only) or "send now" that ignores all autopay constraints

		* Jon F: "double clicking in the Chaintipper tab should open the "pay..."/send window"

		* default tip amount currency: add BCH option

		* headless operation

		* pla-plingggg sound?

		* reddit logon: display "waiting for yout to authorize chaintipper to access your reddit account, check your browser"?

		* amount_bch sometimes scientific notation "1.0E-7", format it

		* reddit.py receive loop: reparse amount on Comment change?

		* preferences
			* amount config (tip amount monikers)

		* currently using first exchange found for the given ccy, maybe improve?

		* html preview of tipping message? even parent?

		* auto-edit tipping message ("EDIT: paid with chaintipper EC plugin")

	* 2.0 / ideas

		* re-allow amount_bch editable, (if payment_status!='paid')

		* enable "incoming"/"outgoing" categories
			* category collapse icon, subitem indentation
			* BUG: right-click on category -> exception
	
		* twitter
		* utxo selection with fuzzy tip amounts (min_amount, max_amount)
		* tooltips in table?
